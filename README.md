# Planetary Auction
Simple auction contracts revolving around a fictitious space auction

This repository is designed for minting ERC721 tokens and using a simple marketplaces with functions to facilitate hosting an auction. The theme behind these contracts is a planetary auction for planets within our solar system but could be extrapolated out into the the universe as well. In the future, perhaps nations or other government/private organizations will bid for the ownership rights to other planets. Since Elon seems to have Mars claimed already, he'd better win this auction!

### Instructions
For the purpose of this coding example I did not include any front end JavaScript scripts to deploy to the mainnet or testnet via CLI. Instead, I recommend using Remix to sample these contracts. First, deploy the PlanetMarket contract. And then use the PlanetMarkets's address to deploy the PlanetAuction. You should then be able to mint a new token representing a planet that can then be auctioned off to the highest bidder.
